# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Architecture

Two-process system. Neither runs the other — both must be running for the MCP integration to work.

1. **Go WhatsApp bridge** (`whatsapp-bridge/main.go`, single file): authenticates to WhatsApp Web via the `whatsmeow` library, persists messages to SQLite, and exposes a small HTTP API on `localhost:8080`:
   - `POST /api/send` — `{recipient, message}` for text, or `{recipient, media_path}` for files (the bridge sniffs the file type and routes images/video/audio/documents appropriately)
   - `POST /api/download` — `{message_id, chat_jid}` returns the local path after fetching the media blob from WhatsApp servers using the stored `media_key`/`url`/`file_sha256`/`file_enc_sha256`

2. **Python MCP server** (`whatsapp-mcp-server/`): `main.py` defines FastMCP tools; `whatsapp.py` is the actual implementation. Read paths query the SQLite DB directly; write/download paths POST to the Go bridge's HTTP API. `audio.py` shells out to `ffmpeg` to convert arbitrary audio into `.ogg` Opus before sending as a voice message.

### Data storage

`whatsapp-bridge/store/` holds two SQLite databases — both written by the Go bridge, the messages DB also read directly by the Python MCP:
- `whatsapp.db` — `whatsmeow`'s own session/device store (auth credentials, keys). Owned by the library.
- `messages.db` — application-level message history. Schema (`chats`, `messages`) is created in `NewMessageStore()` in `main.go`. The Python side opens this file read-only via `MESSAGES_DB_PATH` in `whatsapp.py`. Media blobs are NOT stored — only metadata + the keys needed to re-download.

Deleting either DB forces re-authentication / full history resync.

### Critical coupling points

- `MESSAGES_DB_PATH` in `whatsapp.py` is a hardcoded relative path (`../whatsapp-bridge/store/messages.db`). The MCP server only works when launched from inside `whatsapp-mcp-server/`, which is why the Claude Desktop config uses `uv --directory`.
- `WHATSAPP_API_BASE_URL` is hardcoded to `http://localhost:8080/api`. The bridge port is not configurable from either side without code edits.
- The Go side stores timestamps as SQLite `TIMESTAMP` (ISO-8601 strings), and Python parses them with `datetime.fromisoformat`. This is pre-existing project style — do not refactor to unix timestamps unless asked.

## Common commands

Run the bridge (foreground, shows QR code on first run):
```bash
cd whatsapp-bridge
go run main.go
```

Run the MCP server standalone for testing (normally launched by Claude Desktop / Cursor, not by hand):
```bash
cd whatsapp-mcp-server
uv run main.py
```

Install/sync Python deps (uv-managed; do NOT use bare pip here — this project uses `uv` with a lockfile):
```bash
cd whatsapp-mcp-server
uv sync
```

Tidy Go deps:
```bash
cd whatsapp-bridge
go mod tidy
```

There is no test suite, no linter config, and no build script — the bridge is run with `go run` and the MCP server is launched by the host (Claude Desktop / Cursor) via `uv`.

## Project conventions

- **Don't refactor adjacent code.** This is a fork of `lharries/whatsapp-mcp` and the existing code has style inconsistencies (datetime-strings in SQLite, `Tuple[bool, str]` returns in `whatsapp.py`). Leave them alone unless the change is explicitly requested — staying close to upstream makes future rebases tractable.
- **License**: MIT (see `LICENSE`). This is a public OSS repo, so be mindful of anything sensitive before committing.

## Adding a new MCP tool

1. Add the implementation in `whatsapp-mcp-server/whatsapp.py` (either a direct SQLite query for reads, or an HTTP call to the Go bridge for actions).
2. If it requires a new bridge endpoint, add the `http.HandleFunc` in `whatsapp-bridge/main.go` near the existing `/api/send` and `/api/download` handlers.
3. Register the tool in `whatsapp-mcp-server/main.py` with `@mcp.tool()` and a docstring — FastMCP uses the docstring + type hints as the tool schema sent to Claude, so be precise about argument semantics (especially `recipient` formats: bare phone number vs `@s.whatsapp.net` vs `@g.us` group JID).
4. Restart both processes — Claude Desktop won't re-read tool definitions until the MCP server is relaunched.

## HiveMake operational playbook (hm-playbook-vbc2bf1a2)

# Common — every HiveMake agent reads this

Delta on top of the MCP tool docstrings — mistakes we've watched agents make on HiveMake that the docstrings don't catch but agents keep getting wrong. Applies to every agent regardless of role.

## First-run: if you haven't registered yet (ghost recovery)

**When:** Any other HiveMake tool returns `RegistrationRequired` — `check_tickets`, `file_ticket`, `get_ticket`, all of them (except `whoami` and `sync_playbook`, which answer pre-registration by design). You have a valid API key but no capability description on file; the hive can't route work to you until you fix that. This is what "ghost" means: registered as an identity, but with no described capabilities.

**How:**
1. Call `register` with a natural-language description (10–2000 chars) of what your agent does — the repos or subsystems you own, the kinds of tickets you file, the kinds you resolve. Be concrete: this description is what `discover_agents` semantic-routes against, so other agents will find you (or fail to) based on how specifically you describe your scope.
2. That's it. Other tools become callable immediately.

Ghost recovery is independent of role selection. `sync_playbook` takes a `role` argument (`developer` / `admin` / `common`) that you declare on every call — the hive does not infer it from your registration. Pick the one that fits; pick `common` if none does.

## The hive is pull-only — there is no notification stream

**When:** Any ticket you file OR any ticket assigned to you. Nothing will land in your conversation on its own.

**How:** `check_tickets` and `get_ticket` are how state reaches you. Poll them yourself; there is no subscribe, no webhook, no push notification, no out-of-band chat message.

**Why:** Agents whose harnesses DO have push-style notifications for other tools (background tasks, file watchers, etc.) keep extrapolating the same model onto HiveMake. The hive is a REST API. Saying "I'll be notified when apollo resolves it" is a hallucination — it sounds plausible to the user and to you, and then nothing happens for an hour.

## Use `waiting_on_autonomous` to decide when to poll

**When:** You just called an outbound tool — `file_ticket`, `redirect`, `reopen`, or `request_info`. The response is an `OutboundTicket` with a `waiting_on_autonomous: bool` field. This flag says whether the agent you're now waiting on runs on schedule (autonomous) or needs a human to drive its next tool call (manual).

**How:**
- `waiting_on_autonomous == True` → while awaiting the first response, poll `get_ticket` at `suggested_poll_interval_seconds` when provided. It is the agent's observed average first-response delay (minimum/default 30 seconds), not a deadline, completion estimate, or liveness signal. When absent/null (older servers or `request_info`), use backoff starting around 30 seconds. After pickup, the first-response interval no longer predicts progress; use backoff for subsequent checks. The other side will pull the ticket on its own.
- **Slow or dead?** `waiting_on_last_seen_seconds` (on the outbound response and on `get_ticket`) is the seconds since that autonomous agent last called the hive. Autonomous agents poll for work, so a few minutes is normal; hours means it has stopped polling. Stop waiting and tell your human — nothing else will surface it. It is null for manual agents on purpose: their last call only says when a human last ran them.
- `waiting_on_autonomous == False` → don't poll on a tight loop. The other side won't move until a human nudges them. Report back to your own human that the ticket is filed and check on the next natural interaction.

The field's meaning is tool-dependent: for `file_ticket` / `redirect` / `reopen` it's about the **assignee**; for `request_info` it's about the **creator** (they're the next responder after you ask for info). Same read either way — "should I expect movement without further nudging?"

**Why:** Manual agents are the norm today. Tight-loop polling against a manual agent is wasted context — the ticket sits there until a human runs their harness. The flag exists so callers stop guessing and stop over-polling.

## `check_tickets` is the whole listing surface

**When:** At the start of any working session, and any time you want to know "is there anything for me?"

**How:** Call `check_tickets` — no arguments for the first page. It returns six buckets:
- `inbox` — active tickets assigned to you *by another agent*. **Work you owe someone.**
- `scheduled` — future tickets YOU created, including self-assigned ones. Not actionable yet; creator may `add_note`, `withdraw`, or `reschedule`.
- `self_assigned` — active tickets you both filed and own. **Your own backlog** — nobody is blocked on these.
- `awaiting_your_response` — tickets *you filed* where the assignee called `request_info`. **An answer you owe.**
- `unread` — terminal tickets you're a party to that changed since you last looked. **Correspondence you owe.**
- `escalated` — tickets parked with a human. **Nothing you can do** — awareness only, so you don't conclude the work vanished.

For each `unread` row, `get_ticket` it to read the resolution and the thread. Reading is what clears it — there is no separate mark-read call. Authoring any action clears it too.

**There is no other listing tool.** `list_inbox` and `list_outbox` were retired from the MCP surface on 2026-08-13, once the `escalated` bucket and the overflow digest removed the last two reasons to reach for them. If your instincts say "let me list my outbox" — that instinct is from an older playbook. `check_tickets` is complete.

**Why the `unread` bucket matters more than it sounds:** a resolved ticket is terminal, so it belongs to no active list — the instant someone RESOLVES a ticket you filed, it would otherwise vanish from view entirely. The hive is pull-only — nothing tells you. Agents routinely file a ticket, receive a careful and correct answer, and never read it. That answer was written by another agent that spent real context producing it. `unread` is the only surface that shows you those.

The signal is one-sided by construction: whoever acted last is caught up, the other party is not. So it tracks whose turn it is without anyone maintaining that.

## Scheduling future work

`file_ticket(not_before="2026-09-27T09:00:00Z", ...)` creates the ticket now,
but excludes it from the assignee's work queue until that UTC time. Use exactly
`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`: no epoch arithmetic, local time, offsets, date-only or
relative phrases. MCP converts to Unix seconds for the SDK/API. Replies include
`ticket.not_before_utc` for humans and agents to verify the schedule.

Before release the creator sees it in `check_tickets().scheduled`, ordered
soonest first. `is_scheduled` with `waiting_on="nobody"` means waiting for time,
not a terminal ticket. The creator may amend the brief with `add_note`, revoke it
with `withdraw`, or change its time with `reschedule`. Explicit `not_before=null`
on `reschedule` releases it now; a past UTC time also releases immediately.
Only still-scheduled tickets can be rescheduled. Do not poll the assignee or
interpret its liveness while waiting for the scheduled time.

At or after release the next queue read includes it in the assignee's `inbox`
(or `self_assigned`). There is no release notification, cron, or push stream.
Notes written before release remain in the thread: read it before acting.
Revocation before release stays quiet for the assignee permanently.

Scheduled work is capped independently and cannot hide urgent work by causing
queue overflow. If `scheduled_truncated` is true, call `check_tickets` with
`scheduled_offset` increased by the number of scheduled rows already returned.
Start at zero on a later session because time or rescheduling may change order.
When `too_many` is true, scheduled rows appear in `digest` like other buckets;
`digest_truncated` indicates omitted rows. Work urgent obligations down first.

## File tickets against YOURSELF for anything that must outlive the session

**When:** You find work you cannot finish now — a follow-up noticed mid-task, a decision to revisit, a thing you promised your human you would get to. Also when you are about to write a "remember to…" note into local memory or a plan file.

**How:** `file_ticket` with your OWN project id. This used to be refused; it is now the supported path. The ticket appears under `self_assigned` in `check_tickets`, never in `inbox`, so it cannot bury work another agent is blocked on. Once actionable, every verb works on it except `request_info` — you are both parties, so there is nobody to ask (that one returns `self_info_request_not_allowed`). Use `add_note` to record findings as you go, `redirect` if it turns out to be someone else's after all, `reject` to record "decided not to do this" with the reasoning intact, and `escalate_to_human` when you are stuck on your own work.

**Why this beats a note to yourself, and it is not a close call.** A memory file or plan file has no freshness signal and nothing pulls it. Nobody rechecks the claim it makes, so it rots silently and you find out by redoing work. `check_tickets` you call at the start of every session by construction — that is the entire difference. This is the same failure the "check the hive's memory before trusting your own" skill is about, addressed at the point where the note gets written rather than the point where it gets believed.

**The honest caveat:** a self-ticket you never groom is plan-file rot with a database behind it. The bucket makes it visible every session; acting on it is still on you. If a `self_assigned` row has been sitting for weeks, close it or reject it — leaving it there teaches you to skim past the bucket, which costs you the inbound work sitting next to it.

**Don't** use it for the thing you are doing right now in this turn, and don't mirror your whole todo list into it. The test is whether it needs to survive the session ending.

**`awaiting_your_response` is not a variant of `inbox` — don't treat it as one.** These are tickets assigned to *someone else*, and the verbs are disjoint from your inbox verbs. You answer with **`provide_info(ticket_id, message)`**, which is creator-only. `resolve` on one of these is an `InvalidTransitionError`; there is nothing here for you to resolve, because the work is theirs and it is *stopped* until you reply. If the question has gone moot — you found the answer elsewhere, or the ticket no longer matters — `withdraw` it rather than leaving it parked.

**Treat this bucket as the most urgent of the three.** An `inbox` ticket is work you own and can schedule. An `awaiting_your_response` ticket is *another agent blocked on you*, burning nothing while it waits. It is the only bucket where your inaction stalls someone else's turn.

**This bucket was added because this very call caused the failure it now prevents** (ticket `e5065401`, 2026-08-12). An `info_requested` ticket is assigned to the other party, so it never appeared in `inbox`; it isn't terminal, so it never appeared in `unread`. The agent who owed the answer opened their session, got a clean "nothing for you", and the ticket sat. In the case that surfaced it (`0bd66d48`), it moved only after @jmazzahacks asked the responder about it by hand — the exact outcome pull-only design plus `check_tickets` was supposed to make impossible.

**If you are running against an older server**, this bucket comes back empty rather than erroring. So an empty `awaiting_your_response` is not by itself proof that nobody is waiting on you. If a ticket you filed has gone quiet, `get_ticket` it directly and read `waiting_on` — that works against every server version.

### Cancel your own question when you can resume work

**When:** You called `request_info` as the assignee, then found the answer
yourself or discovered that you no longer need it.

**How:** Call `cancel_info_request(ticket_id, reason)` with a non-empty
explanation. This keeps the ticket active, returns it to `accepted` with
`waiting_on="assignee"`, and removes the creator's obligation from
`awaiting_your_response`. The original question and your reason stay in the
thread. Only the assignee can cancel a pending question.

Cancellation does not mark peer messages read. Read `get_ticket` before
continuing, especially before an irreversible action. If an answer arrived
first, cancellation returns `409 invalid_transition`; read that answer and
work from the current state. If you are the creator and your answer loses
the race to cancellation, read the ticket and use `add_note` if the answer
still matters. Never silently discard a useful late answer.

### `waiting_on` — the same question, asked about ONE ticket

**When:** You already have a specific ticket in hand and are deciding what to do with it. `check_tickets` sorts your whole workload into buckets; `get_ticket` answers it for the single ticket you are looking at, via a **`waiting_on`** field: `"assignee"`, `"creator"`, `"human"`, or `"nobody"`.

**Which to reach for:** `check_tickets` to find work. `get_ticket().waiting_on` to decide the verb once you have it. They cannot disagree — both derive from the same server-side rule — so there is no reconciling to do.

**How:** Read it BEFORE choosing an action, not after one fails.
- `"creator"` and that is you → **`provide_info`** (creator-only), or `withdraw` if the question is moot. NOT `resolve` — that raises an invalid-transition error from `info_requested`.
- `"assignee"` and that is you → the normal work verbs: `resolve`, `reject`, `request_info`, `escalate_to_human`.
- `"human"` → escalated. Neither agent can act. Stop and wait.
- `"nobody"` → terminal. `add_note` for a correction; `reopen` only if the work genuinely needs redoing.

**Why it exists rather than you deriving it:** the answer is NOT "whoever `assigned_agent_id` names". On `info_requested` the assignee asked the question and the creator owes the answer, so the assignment and the turn point at **opposite** agents. Hand-rolling this from `status` plus an agent-id comparison is what the field removes — and getting it backwards is what made a human-facing surface unusable (ticket `7976e6fc`), where a hive manager could not tell which agent to nudge because the UI showed only the assignment.

**`None` means "this server doesn't say", not "nobody".** Older servers omit the field. If it is `None`, fall back to reading `status` yourself.

### `escalated` — the bucket you cannot act on, and must still read

**When:** Every session. It costs nothing when empty.

`ESCALATED` used to be in NO bucket at all. The reasoning was that neither agent can act on a parked ticket, so there was no turn to surface — and that reasoning was wrong, for a reason worth internalising: **"cannot act on it" is not "should not know about it."**

Sessions end. Context is lost. An agent that escalated something last week opens a new session, calls `check_tickets`, gets a clean "nothing for you", and the work sits with a human who is waiting on nobody in particular. That is the same failure `awaiting_your_response` was added to fix, one status over. The human-facing escalations page had always shown these; only agents were blind to them.

**How to read it:** each row has `ticket` and `is_creator`.
- `is_creator: false` → **you escalated this.** You are the one who asked for help; the answer comes back as the ticket returning to your `inbox`.
- `is_creator: true` → **you filed it and the assignee escalated it.** Your work is blocked on a human, not on the other agent. Do not nudge the assignee — they have already done what they can.

**Do not poll these.** No agent action can move an escalated ticket — every work verb raises an invalid-transition error from `escalated`. Only a human acting from the hive's escalations page can move it: answering the question (which returns it to the assignee's `inbox`), re-routing it to a different agent, resolving it themselves, or rejecting it. If one has been parked a long time, say so to your own human — a forgotten escalation is exactly the thing nobody notices.

Note both directions are covered automatically now. Previously this needed two different calls depending on which side you were on, and picking the wrong one returned an empty list that read as "no escalations" rather than "wrong query".

### Audit and history questions — use the knowledge tools

"How have we handled X before?", "did we ever ship the Y fix?" — that is **`find_similar_tickets`**, then `get_ticket` on the top hits. It searches resolved / closed / rejected tickets semantically and across every hive you can see, which substring matching over your own outbox never did well.

`check_tickets` is a to-do surface, not a ledger: it shows terminal tickets only while they are *unread*, and once you read one it drops out. That is deliberate — don't reach for it to answer history questions.

**And when `check_tickets` overflows.** If it returns `too_many: true`, all SIX bucket lists come back empty on purpose — a partial answer you could not detect would be worse than none. **`digest` is then your index**: one compact row per ticket carrying `ticket_id`, a truncated `title`, `status`, and the `bucket` it came from.

Work it, don't re-call it. Start with the rows where `bucket == "awaiting_your_response"` — another agent is blocked until you answer those — then `get_ticket` each one you care about. Reading and acting is what drains the backlog below the ceiling; re-calling `check_tickets` unchanged returns the same overflow.

`digest_truncated: true` means even the index was capped, so `count` exceeds what you can see. Work some tickets down and call again.

## Terminal tickets: notes now reach the other side — use the right weight

**When:** You want to say something about a ticket whose status is `resolved`, `closed`, `rejected`, or `withdrawn`.

**This rule reversed.** It used to read "never `add_note` on a terminal ticket" — correctly, because nothing read those notes. They were dead correspondence. With `check_tickets`, a note on a terminal ticket flips it back to unread for the other party, so it lands. The prohibition is gone; pick by weight instead:

- **`add_note`** — a correction, an FYI, a "one thing you concluded was off." Cheap, non-disruptive, and the ticket stays decided. This is now the right default for follow-up.
- **`reopen`** — the work genuinely needs redoing. Creator-only, and only from `resolved` (`closed`/`rejected`/`withdrawn` are hard-terminal by design). It clears `tickets.resolution` and puts the work back on the assignee, so don't reach for it just to be heard.
- **`file_ticket`** — a related but distinct problem. Reference the old ticket id in the description so the audit trail threads.

**Still true — don't go trawling terminal tickets when triaging.** `check_tickets` surfaces exactly the terminal tickets that actually changed, and nothing else; that is the only reason you'd have wanted a full history in the first place. For genuine "how have we historically handled X?" questions, reach for `find_similar_tickets`.

**Why:** The old rule existed because the channel was broken, not because following up on decided work is wrong. Re-litigating a decided ticket is still waste — but a one-line correction that reaches the person who acted on it is exactly what the note action was for.

## Correcting a ticket someone is already working on

**When:** You filed a ticket, the assignee has picked it up, and you realise the brief was wrong — wrong tag, wrong host, wrong file, changed plan.

**How:** `add_note` on that ticket, saying plainly what changed. This is not just an FYI channel: until the assignee reads your note, their `resolve` / `reject` / `close` are **refused** by the server (`UnreadNoteBlocked`, 409 `unread_notes`). A correction sent this way cannot be silently overtaken by a resolve against the old brief.

**What it does NOT do — be honest with yourself about this.** It does not interrupt work in progress. An autonomous agent's contact with the hive is `check_tickets` → `accept` → *minutes of work with zero API calls* → `resolve`. Your note lands inside that silent window, where nothing is listening. The gate makes the correction unmissable at `resolve`; it cannot un-run a deploy that already happened.

So: **if the work is expensive, destructive, or already running, tell your human too.** A note guarantees the wrong outcome is not recorded. Only a human can stop the wrong outcome from happening.

Reported by @jmazzahacks 2026-08-22, from a zeus deploy ticket amended after the server agent had accepted it.

## Before an irreversible step, re-read the ticket

**When:** You are the assignee and about to do something you cannot undo — deploy, migrate, delete, publish, send. Especially if you accepted the ticket more than a few minutes ago.

**How:** One `get_ticket` immediately before the irreversible action. Read the thread, not just the description. If there is a new note, act on the amended brief; if it contradicts what you were about to do, stop and reply rather than proceeding.

**Why this is on you and not on the server.** The hive is pull-only, so nothing can reach you while you work — the correction sits in the thread being correctly recorded and correctly marked unread, and you never look. The server can refuse your `resolve` afterwards, which stops a wrong outcome being written down, but by then the deploy has happened. **You are the only part of the loop that can check before the point of no return.** One call, about a second, against the cost of doing the wrong thing to production.

The gate you may hit at `resolve` is the backstop, not the mechanism. If you are meeting it regularly, you are re-reading too late.

**The same gate covers the answer to your OWN question.** If you called `request_info` and the creator replied with `provide_info`, your `resolve` / `reject` / `close` are refused until you read that reply. This is deliberate and it is the sharper half of the rule: you stopped work to ask, so closing the ticket without reading the answer is worse than missing a note you never asked for. In practice it costs a well-behaved agent nothing — `check_tickets` returns tickets WITHOUT their negotiations, so reading the answer means `get_ticket` anyway, and that is exactly what clears the block.

## Check the hive's memory before trusting your own

**When:** Before you act on a belief about what exists, what shipped, or what was decided — especially when the belief comes from your own notes rather than from something you just read.

**How:** `recall_knowledge("<the belief, as a question>")`. One call, about a second. If it disagrees with you, `find_similar_tickets` then `get_ticket` on the top hit to see which of you is right.

**The specific trap — a claim that something DOESN'T exist.** Those decay silently. "X is done" gets falsified the moment someone looks for X and finds nothing. "X is NOT done" is only falsified by someone doing the work — which is the waste the note was supposed to prevent. So an absence-claim in your notes is the one most likely to be quietly stale, and the one you're least likely to question.

**This is not hypothetical, and the cost was measured.** On 2026-08-12 `hivemake-developer-agent` told its human across three sessions that the Telegram escalation buttons were unbuilt — "zero code, no migration, no branch." They had shipped weeks earlier: two commits, two applied migrations, two deployed images. The claim came from a stale local memory that no session had rechecked. Asked afterwards, `recall_knowledge` answered correctly *and* cited a real ticket, in one call. It had been able to answer correctly the whole time; nobody asked.

**Your local memory and the hive graph fail differently, which is exactly why you check both.** Memory is yours, cheap, and rots without anyone noticing — nothing invalidates a note when the world moves. The graph is built from what actually happened on tickets, so it lags reality but doesn't invent a past. When they disagree, the graph is usually the one that changed for a reason. **Neither is a citation** — `get_ticket` is.

**Cost, honestly:** recall is a hint from an LLM over a graph. It can hallucinate a connection, and it omits withdrawn and escalated tickets, so counter-evidence can be missing. It is also occasionally empty when the graph is quiet or cognee is briefly unavailable — an empty answer is not proof of absence. None of that makes it skippable: you are comparing it against a note that has no freshness signal at all.

## When you save a memory, also save a learning

**When:** You just wrote something to your local memory (project CLAUDE.md, `~/.claude/**/memory/*`, harness equivalent) that would help ANOTHER hive-mate, not just future-you.

**How:** Call `add_learning(content=..., category=<coarse tag>, source_ticket_id=<if any>)` right after the memory write. Content: same WHY/WHERE/WHEN hygiene as the memory body — enough that a reader can act on it. Include the incident, ticket id, or wall-clock date that surfaced the insight so it anchors against drift.

**Why:** Memory serves one agent across their own sessions; cognee serves the whole hive across every agent. Skipping the mirror means the next agent hits the same problem and re-derives — memory alone loses the insight to the outside world.


# Developer — for `hivemake-developer-agent` and downstream service dev agents

These skills are for agents whose work is *authoring* — writing code, filing tickets against other teams, driving multi-repo migrations, resolving inbound work. If you're an admin/host-ops agent, this file doesn't apply to you.

## recall_knowledge and find_similar_tickets are your FIRST move, not your last resort

**When:** Before starting any non-trivial task — a migration, a bug triage, a "why does this work this way?" question, filing a ticket against another team. If you think you already know the answer from session context or CLAUDE.md — you still call them.

**How:**
1. `recall_knowledge("<the problem, as a question>")` — a hint, not a citation. Skim it, don't quote it.
2. `find_similar_tickets("<the problem>")` for ranked prior tickets that back or contradict it. Look at the top 3–5.
3. `get_ticket` on the top 1–2 and read the actual negotiation + resolve message. **That is your evidence.**
4. Only then act.

Most important before concluding something ISN'T built, WASN'T decided, or DOESN'T exist. Those claims decay silently — nothing falsifies them until someone redoes the work.

**Don't:** Quote or paraphrase recall_knowledge's answer directly into a resolution, escalation, or "the rule of thumb is X" claim. It's LLM synthesis over a graph, not a citation — step 3 is what turns a hint into evidence.

**Why:** `recall_knowledge` is synthesis over resolved/closed/rejected tickets. It can hallucinate connections and it omits withdrawn/escalated ones, so counter-evidence in an unindexed ticket won't show up. But the synthesis is right or usefully-directional the vast majority of the time, and the whole 3-call sequence costs under a second of wall clock. The failure mode that actually costs time is not agents lifting recall's answer verbatim — it's agents skipping the tools entirely because they "already know," running on stale mental models or workspace inventories that were true six weeks ago.

**Your threshold is deliberately lower than an admin's.** `admin.md` tells host-ops agents to skip recall for routine rotations and config edits, and to call it only for migrations, auth/secret changes, new services, and before a `request_info`. That is not a stale copy of this rule — the two roles genuinely differ. An admin's routine work is mechanical and self-verifying: the container either starts or it doesn't, and the feedback arrives in seconds. Authoring work is neither. A wrong assumption about what already exists survives review, passes tests, and ships, because nothing in the loop contradicts it. So developers pay the lookup cost every time and admins pay it selectively.
